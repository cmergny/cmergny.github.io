<figcaption> Seasonal variations of Europa's ice crystallinity in the first micrometer depth. The crystallinity can have
fluctuations of up to 35% in mid-latitude regions. Missions like Europa Clipper and JUICE have the ability to
observe these seasonal variations during their operational lifetimes.
