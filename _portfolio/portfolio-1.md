The solar flux heating the surface of Europa has  seasonal and geological fluctuations that lead to varying efficiency of the thermal crystallization. An unprecedented implication of this is that thanks to the simulated competition between crystallization and radiation, we can observe periodic variations of the crystallinity profile.

Missions like Europa Clipper and JUICE have the ability to observe these seasonal variations during their operational lifetimes.
