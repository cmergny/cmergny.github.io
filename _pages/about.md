The microstructure of icy planetary surfaces evolves under the inï¬‚uence of a complex interplay of coupled physical processes.
My work consists in the construction of a multiphysics simulation model "LunaIcy", which in-tegrates an accurate solar flux calculation, a
stable and fast thermal solver, a model of icemetamorphism/sintering, as well as a model of crystallization by temperature and amorphization by irradiation.
