The Bond albedo was determined in our article DOI [10.1051/0004-6361/202453058](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202453058) for 20 regions of interest (ROIs) based on Voyager and New Horizons data using Hapke parameters. By correlating these values with the average pixel intensities for each ROI on the USGS map, we determined a linear relationship between the Bond albedo and pixel intensity.

<figcaption> The extrapolated Europa Bond albedo map. Anchor-point ROIs are indicated by semi-transparent white squares. The high resolution and coverage of this map will notably allow for better thermal modeling
of Europa. The USGS map data gap is also present on the south pole. Longitude is expressed according to the west-increasing definition. </figcaption>

The Bond albedo map produced in our paper is available in the IPSL Data Catalog at DOI [10.14768/d302ffb6-
